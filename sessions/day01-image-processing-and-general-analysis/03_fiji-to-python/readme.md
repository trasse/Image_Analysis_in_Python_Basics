Thanks for coming here to learn a little bit about Python, and how we can make python work with FIJI.

There are three lessons in this module, in the first, we go over how to make a test image of random circles.  There are two Jupyter notebooks for this lesson, <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/Make%20Circle%20Images%20--%20Student%20Copy.ipynb">Make Circle Images -- Student Copy.ipynb"</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/Make%20Circle%20Images%20--%20Instructor%20Copy.ipynb">"Make Circle Images -- Instructor Copy.ipynb."</a> The student copy is outlined, but the code is not filled in, so you can work your way through the lesson and fill in the blanks, to get an idea for the code.  The instructor copy is fully coded.  The results from running this code is an image <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/random_circles.tiff">'random_circles.tiff.'</a>

In the second lesson, we build a FIJI Script in Jython (FIJI's python) in order to detect the circles we made in our test image.  The demonstration script files for this are <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/FIJI_circle_finder.py">"FIJI_circle_finder.py"</a> and <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/FIJI_circle_finder_Simulated_cells.py">"FIJI_circle_finder_Simulated_cells.py".</a>  The simulated cells image given at the end of the lessons is <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/simulated%20cells.png">"simulated cells.png."</a> The output of the script will be a csv file, which I have called <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/Results_random_circles_CoronaTime.csv">"Results_random_circles_CoronaTime.csv"</a> for the random circles image.

In the third lesson, we go over how to use Pandas to validate and explore data, as well as doing some calculations on dataframes.  There are again two Jupyter notebooks here, "Pandas intro Cambridge -- Student Copy.ipynb" and "Pandas intro Cambridge -- Instructor Copy.ipynb." As in lesson one, the student copy is to follow along with and fill in code, while the instructor copy is filled in. 
Lesson 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxssHuvPfLg

At the end of the course, there is an excercise where you can build your FIJI script in Jython to detect the cells in <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/simulated%20cells.png">'simulated cells.png'</a>, export that to a csv file, and then do some data analysis on that with Pandas.  That excercise is in <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/Excercise_Real_Cells.ipynb">'Excercise_Real_Cells.ipynb'</a> with some model answers in <a href="https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis/blob/master/sessions/day01-image-processing-and-general-analysis/03_fiji-to-python/Excercise_Real_Cells_Model_Answers.ipynb">'Excercise_Real_Cells_Model_Answers.ipynb'</a>.

This is the first time we've attemped this course online, and I welcome any comments.
